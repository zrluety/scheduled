# Schedule D Readme

The Schedule D Project consists of of two subprojects, the Schedule D workbooks and the Schedule D Application.
The workbook and application can each be developed independently so long as they each agree to the contract.

Schedule D is one of the many schedules attached to U.S. Individual Income Tax Return Form 1040 that you must complete to report any gains or losses you realize from the sale of your capital assets. Your capital assets are, pretty much, everything you own and use for pleasure or investment purposes. The capital assets you are most likely to report on Schedule D are the stocks, bonds, and homes you sell.
